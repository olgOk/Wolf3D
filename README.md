### About the Project
-------------------------
This project is aimed to get understanding of the technique used to create ray casting 3D scenes. 
The main technique covered is similar to the one used by [IdSoftware](1) in the Wolfenstein 3D source code. 
The main part of the project is to understand the mathematics used for ray casting,
and implement a full-featured projected environment using JavaScript language.

### Features
-----------------
* 3D Wall Projections
* 2D Map and Player Movement
* Handling of key events
* Using of [p5.js](2) labrary for graphic representation 

### How to use
-------------------
Download or git clone the project folders, open `index.html`
