Basics of the ray casting technique used in the Wolfenstein 3D source code and implementation using JavaScript

![]
This course explains the technique used to create 
ray casting 3D scenes. The main technique covered is similar to the one used by
IdSoftware in the Wolfenstein 3D source code. You will understand the mathematics used for ray casting,
and implement a full-featured projected environment using a language called JavaScript.
To make the most out of this course, you should be familiar with the basic building blocks of programming, s
uch as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
